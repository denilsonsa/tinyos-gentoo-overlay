# Gentoo Overlay for Tinyos 2.x

## Overview

This is a Gentoo Overlay for TinyOS 2.x.

The current state, as of 2011, is a half-working overlay: the ebuilds are
"working" (as in portage being able to use them correctly), but the installed
packages may not work correctly. In special, the **nesc** package is not being
correctly installed/configured, and thus other TinyOS packages also fail to
compile. Maybe this is a bug in **nesc**, and thus should be patched. See
these messages from [tinyos-help][tinyos-help] mailing list:

## History

This overlay was originally created by Aurelien Francillon (aurelf) in late
2006, and later had contributions from Sandro Bonazzola (sandrobonazzola) in
2008. Since then, the contributions have halted, as both authors have moved on
to other projects.

In 2011, about 2 years later, Denilson SÃ¡ (denilsonsa) tried to use this
overlay but couldn't, as it became broken due the lack of maintenance. He did
some efforts to fix/update the ebuilds and move the overlay from a self-hosted
SVN to GitHub, but later had to stop, as he also moved on to other projects.

This overlay in GitHub is an invitation to contributions! None of the previous
authors can work on this overlay anymore. If need TinyOS on Gentoo, feel free
to fork this project and update it!

 TODO:

++ Classpath modification by eselect-tinyos is broken
++ Modify eselect tinyos in order to change class path and makerules
+ Clarify which package should be dropped / which should be kept
